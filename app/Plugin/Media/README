  Plugin for CakePHP


  ---- A CakePHP plugin enabling transfer/manipulation/embedding
       of files in 23 ways.

  Synopsis
  --------
  This plugin was conceived as a thorough solution to all the needs coming from
  dealing with media files in a web application. Moreover the idea was to show
  how much a well maintained plugin can be worth it and inspire others to do the
  same. The plugin slowly evolved (and in fact still does) from a very distinct
  set of tightly coupled components into something much more flexible. This
  allows you to use only the functionality you really need.

  Status
  ------
  Originally written for CakePHP 1.2 and 1.3 and maintained since as early as
  2007 this project will not receive any future updates. There will be no port of
  it - lead by myself - to make it compatible with CakePHP 2.x or any future
  version thereafter.

  This project forms my very first successful open source project. It was
  originally been written to scratch my own itch (namely http://npiece.com). I
  saw how this plugin also added missing functionality to the CakePHP universe
  and was indeed useful to a lot of CakePHP users.

  I'm leaving this project behind for several reasons. The most important one
  being that I want to regain the ability to focus on new projects - not
  necessarily software projects. Another - probably more technical reason - is
  that I want to make things more generic and not specific to a certain frame-
  work anymore. Parts of this plugin have already been extracted and will live
  under https://github.com/davidpersson/mm.

  Thanks for all the discussion surrounding this plugin,
  the support, watching, following and contributions!
